### Hi, I'm Maria 👋🏽

Currently a full-stack web developer, but I like to think I'm a jack of all trades. A highly analytical and creative thinker with a background in neuropsychology and math, I made the leap into web dev because lifelong learning is for me! I produce work that is full of heart, and am dedicated to refining my craft. From learning to read and write Bengali so that I could partake in classical music lessons, to learning to read and write code so that I can build full stack web solutions, I like to dive deep into any challenge I undertake, and I want to be a true polyglot.
